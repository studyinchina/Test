                                    <ol>
                                        <li>

                                        <li><p>Guilin & Yangshuo</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Sanya (Oriental Hawaii)</p></li>

                                    </ol>

                                    <p>We understand that many students are visiting China/Asia the first time and may not go there again in the near future, so we try to help with some side trips if possible, such that students can see those additional famous and beautiful places at a fraction of the usual cost (should they make the trip on their own).</p>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Announcement of side trips is made to the program participants only after the international flights are confirmed, in April for the summer program and in November for the winter program.&nbsp; At that time, the participants will decide which side trips they want to make.</p>

                                    <p>Scroll down this page for details of each side trip.        </p>
                                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Please be aware of the following:</h3>
                                    <ol> 
                                        <li>
                                            <p class="style1">Side trips are additional cost, which will be given to the participants after the program is put together (around 2 weeks after the application deadline). Depending on the distance, number of days, means of transportation and service provided, the cost of the side trips varies, from about $85 to about $650 if the trip requires more than one flight within China, or about $1,500 for Tibet. Chinese airlines are more expensive.</p></li>
                                        <li class="style1"><p>Each side trip requires sufficient interest to happen (about 15 people).</p></li>
                                        <li class="style1">Not all the side trips may be organized during each program.&nbsp; Sanya may be offered in the winter; Guilin is good for the summer.</li>
                                        <li class="style1"><p>The length of side trips varies (some for one day and some 2-4 days).</p></li>
                                        <li><p class="style1">We try to schedule the side trips apart from each other, so that the trips do not conflict with the class schedules (some side trips are part of the course content). One faculty will go on each side trip, and the students who are not making the side trip will stay in Nanjing for their classes.</p></li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <h2>Hong Kong</h2>

                                    <!-- IMAGE -->
                                    <img class="right" src="images/side_trips_images/hong_kong/H.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="135" />

                                    <p>The side trip to Hong Kong happens around the first weekend of our stay in Nanjing (after tours of Beijing and Xi’an).</p>

                                    <p>Hong Kong is well-known and you can easily view some pictures online. Here are some:</p>
                                    <ul> 
                                        <li><p><a href="http://conneva.com/blog/archives/images/Hong%20Kong%20Island%20At%20Night.jpg">Hong Kong 1</a></p></li>
                                        <li><p><a href="http://images.china.cn/attachement/jpg/site1007/20080228/000802c98ccc0930aace28.jpg">Hong Kong 2</a></p></li>
                                    </ul> 

                                    <p>Airline tickets from Nanjing to Hong Kong are expensive (about US$290 one way), and hotels in Hong Kong are also expensive.  However, it costs less if we fly from Nanjing to Shenzhen (which is right next to Hong Kong). To make the Hong Kong side trip affordable, we choose to stop in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong. Travel agencies will arrange flights and hotels for the group.</p>

                                    <p>Shenzhen is an exciting modern city.  It was still a fishing village in mid 1980s, but now it is a huge booming cosmopolitan with about 12 million people, and serves as the back garden for people of Hong Kong, many of whom commute between the two cities on a daily basis.  You can search for information about Shenzhen online.  See a picture of Shenzhen <a href="http://dorsher.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/shenzhen1.jpg">here</a></p>

In addition, the silent coconut gardens, the customs of the Li, Miao and Hui nationalities.</p>

                                    <p>The most beautiful part of the trip is the boat ride on the river from Guilin to Yangshuo.  Yangshuo is about 1 hour and half away from Guilin by bus, and about 4 hours by boat. Of course, tourists all choose to travel by boat.</p>

                                    <p>One famous saying goes like this: Guilin’s scenery is the best in the world, but Yangshuo still beats Guilin. All tourists, Chinese and non-Chinese alike, especially dream to see the stunning landscape of Guilin and the breathtaking beauty of the Lijiang River.</p>

                                    <p>Yangzhou, a not-too-big yet very pretty city, is only about one hour and half north of Nanjing. With the <span class="underline">Grand Canal</span> running through the city and the <span class="underline">Yangtze River</span> flowing from west to east to its south, Yangzhou furthered an indigenous and growing economic market of China's urban centers throughout the ages since the Sui dynasty.</p>

                                    <p>During Tang Dynasty, Yangzhou was very prosperous, comparable to modern NYC, Shanghai or Beijing.  At one point, about one third of the country’s tax revenue came from Yangzhou where rich merchants, scholars, poets, artists, etc, chose to enjoy their life.  The city was also one of the most-picked destinations for emperors when they travelled outside the capital in the north.</p>

                                    <p>Yangzhou has a history of 2,500 years.  The city was one of ten cities in the world around 1800 A.D, and had the largest population over half million.</p>

                                    <p>Until the 19th century, Yangzhou acted as a major national political, financial and trade center and a transport hub duo to its excellent location at the junction of the Yangtze, the Grand Canal and the Huaihe River. This historical period had left Yangzhou a large number of treasures, including valuable architectures and arts, splendid culture and well-known celebrities.</p>

                                    <p>You all know about <span class="bold">Marco Polo</span>; he once served as a municipal official in Yangzhou around 1282-1287 under Yuan Emperor Kubilai Khan.</p>

                                    <p>Under the 2nd Emperor Yangdi (604-617) of the Sui Dynasty (581-617), the city was the southern capital of China (called Jiangdu) upon the completion of the Grand Canal. Thus, it became a leading economic and cultural center and major port of foreign trade and external exchanges since the Tang Dynasty (618-907). There lived many Arab and Persian merchants.</p>

                                    <p>The mosque complex at the <span class="bold">Tomb of Puhaddin</span> is essentially a Ming Dynasty graveyard that includes the tomb of Puhaddin. According to information at the tomb, he was a 16th generation descendant of Muhammad, The Prophet. The tomb is on the eastern bank of the (Old) Grand Canal in the eastern sector of the city and is adjacent to a mosque which houses a collection of valuable materials documenting China's relations with Muslim countries.</p>

                                    <p>Senior Monk Jianzhen from Yangzhou brought Buddhism to Japan, after six attempts to cross the dangerous seas.</p>

                                    <p>“Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou (Yangzhou Baguai)” is the name for a group of eight Chinese painters known in the Qing dynasty for rejecting the orthodox ideas about painting in favor of a style deemed expressive and individualistic.</p>

                                    <h3>The Slender West Lake</h3>

                                    <p>The Slender West Lake, with a history since the Qing Dynasty, was originally a natural river course connecting to the Grand Canal during the Sui (581-618) and Tang Dynasty (618-907) periods. In order to celebrate the Emperor Qianlong’s visit, the river was widened and the shores along the river were landscaped with numerous gardens, pavilions, and pagodas. The purpose to use “Slender” to describe the lake is to contrast it with the West Lake of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, one of Jiangsu’s neighbor provinces, by emphasizing that the lake is narrower but longer, like a slender and tall beauty.</p>

                                    <p>The lake is 4.3 kilometers in length with an area of over 30 hectares. Main tourist interests include Spring Willows along the Long Causeway, Xuyuan Garden, Xiaohin Hill, Chuitai Terrace, Five Pavilions and White Pagoda.</p>

                                    <p>The lake is typical of the Chinese water-based garden art combining the elegance of the south with magnificence of the north. Taking a boat tour in the lake or a walk along its shores will conveniently bring you to other Yangzhou's tourist attractions in the city.</p>

                                    <h3>Yangzhou Cuisine</h3>

                                    <!-- IMAGE -->
                                    <img class="right" src="images/side_trips_images/yangzhou/YZ-001.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="135" />

                                    <p>Some of China’s most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called Huaiyang, which is a distinctive and masterful skill that locals are quite proud of.</p>

                                    <p>Yangzhou dishes may be one of the reasons why the people of Yangzhou are so infatuated with their city. They have an appealing color, aroma, taste and also appearance. The original color of each ingredient is preserved after cooking, and no oily sauce is added, so as to retain the fresh savor of the food.</p>

                                    <p>Yangzhou buns (steamed ones) are the most delicious. We will certainly have some (and bring some back to our hotel in Nanjing if you want).</p>

                                    <p>In Yangzhou all dishes, whether cheap or expensive, are elaborate. Cooks will not scrimp on their work, even with Zhugansi (stewed sliced dry bean curd), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed. The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. It is not only Yangzhou cooks but also the ordinary people who are conscientious about cooking.</p>
